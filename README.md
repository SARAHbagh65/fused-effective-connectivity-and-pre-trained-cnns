# fused-effective-connectivity-and-pre-trained-cnns-lstm


the aim of this project is recognition four emotional states using combination of pre-trained CNN-LSTM models and fusion of three well-known effective connectivity measures (Transfer Entropy (TE), direct directed transfer function (dDTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC)) from Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. EEG signals were from two public databases of DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI. Processing steps were as below: 1-Pre-processing EEG signals and remove noise and artifacts, to this end EEGs were monitored and pre-processed using EEGLAB toolbox, MATLAB software. 2-Estimate dDTF and PDC effective connectivity measures through the SIFT toolbox, MATLAB software. Each dDTF and PDC resulted in channel- channel- frequency components-time matrixes. Also, TE was estimated through the HERMER toolbox, MATLAB software. TE obtained location-location-time matrixes. three kinds of matrixes were considered as location-location information and the averaging was done on the frequency dimension of PDC and dDTF. the fused image was built from three consecutive time windows of each measure in row and arranging these in columns. Then, the fused image was plotted and saved in .jpg format.
